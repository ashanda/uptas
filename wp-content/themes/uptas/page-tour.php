                            Tutor Factor- With more than 10 years of teaching experience in
                            both MOE schools and University, Dr Aw and Miss Tham had
                            worked with a wide spectrum of students, ranging from
                            those who are gifted in Chemistry to those who hated
                            Chemistry. Dr Aw explain concepts to students in a simplified
                            manner. Armed with years of experience and familiarity with
                            common gaps faced by students, he is able to give accurate
                            feedback to students and spot on their difficulties. In this
                            manner, every class is highly efficient and productive for the
                            students.

                            years of interactions with students, we have discovered that
                            the secret to doing well in exam lies in getting the key
                            concept of the chapter correct.

                            An analogy will be if focuses are doors, then key concept
                            will be the keys to the doors where students will see the big
                            picture of the content. In this manner, we will further break
                            down each focus point to concept keys where
                            misconception will be clarified and the door to distinctions
                            will be opened.

                        <p>In Uptas Learning Hub, we recognise that students
                            attention span is short and follows a general trend as
                            indicated in graph 1. Therefore, the lessons are planned
                            carefully where there will be regular changes in the
                            activities of the class so as to interrupt the process of losing
                            their attention (Graph 2). In this way, this will help students
                            focus better and absorb more in class.
